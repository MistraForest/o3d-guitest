# Estimate effort for Gauge / Taiko performance test
Tags: happy_path

Estimate effort for Gauge / Taike performance test for ODUS3. 
The test should just cover a "happy path", i.e. logging in, doing a search, browsing the PDL, navigationg to a PDP, optionally downloading a PDF.

The estimation should be based on a prototype that logs in to odus3 and clicks on a category.

## Search browsing the PDL, navigationg to a PDP downloading a PDF
* Goto O3D page
* Enter credentials
* Browse PDL Zubeh√∂r
* Goto PDP
